Strava doesn't have a great way to customize the visibilty of your activities, and it's gotten worse over time.

This tool attempts to take back some of that control, using a webhook to update the visibility.

This probably won't work for anyone other than me, because while Strava has an API, it doesn't actually let you change an activity's visibility.

To get around this I had to screen-scrape using Mechanize; which requires an actual userid/password instead of OAuth.

If you actually want to use this, open a ticket and I'll put some docs together on how you can self-host.
